# Korean Keyboard - Bugs & Issues Tracking

**Document Version:** 3.0  
**Last Updated:** December 2024  
**Status:** Modern Korean Complete - All Core Features Working

## 🚨 Critical Issues

### 1. Final Jamo Composition Failure ✅ RESOLVED
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Closed  
**Description:** Keyboard handles initial + medial correctly, but fails with initial + medial + final. The final consonant becomes the initial for the next syllable block.

**Expected Behavior:**
- `ㅅㅗㅎ` should compose to `솧` (one syllable block)
- Final consonant should complete the current syllable

**Actual Behavior:**
- `ㅅㅗㅎ` results in `솗ㅎ` or similar incorrect composition
- Final consonant `ㅎ` becomes initial for next block
- Syllable composition is broken for 3-character sequences

**Technical Details:**
- Issue in `processKoreanInput` function logic
- Problem likely in consonant handling when `currentSyllable.final` exists
- May be related to Unicode composition algorithm
- Affects all final consonants, not just specific ones

**Resolution:**
- ✅ Added `isComposedHangulSyllable()` and `decomposeHangulSyllable()` functions
- ✅ Fixed Unicode mapping between Jamo and Compatibility Jamo characters
- ✅ Created specific helper functions for each jamo type (initial, medial, final)
- ✅ Corrected final offset calculation to use 1-indexed values per Wikipedia standard
- ✅ All modern Korean syllables now compose correctly

**Test Cases:**
- `ㅅㅗㅎ` → `솧` ✅
- `ㄱㅏㄴ` → `간` ✅
- `ㅂㅏㅁ` → `밤` ✅
- `바ㅇ` → `방` ✅

### 2. Complex Final Consonant Decomposition ✅ RESOLVED
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Closed  
**Description:** When a syllable with a complex final consonant is followed by a vowel, the first component of the complex final is lost instead of being retained in the original syllable.

**Expected Behavior:**
- `앉ㅏ` should become `안자` (앉 → 안 + 자)
- First component of complex final should stay in original syllable
- Second component should become initial of next syllable

**Actual Behavior:**
- `앉ㅏ` resulted in `아자` (lost the `ㄴ` from `ㄵ`)
- Complex final was completely removed from original syllable
- Only second component was used for next syllable

**Technical Details:**
- Issue in `processKoreanInput` function when handling complex finals followed by vowels
- Missing logic to decompose complex finals into components
- No mapping between complex finals and their component parts

**Resolution:**
- ✅ Added `COMPLEX_FINAL_TO_COMPONENTS` mapping for all modern complex finals
- ✅ Created `decomposeComplexFinal()` function to split complex finals
- ✅ Updated input processor to handle complex final decomposition:
  - Keep first component in original syllable (e.g., ㄵ → ㄴ stays in 안)
  - Use second component as initial for next syllable (e.g., ㄵ → ㅈ becomes initial)
- ✅ All complex final transitions now work correctly

**Test Cases:**
- `앉ㅏ` → `안자` ✅
- `닭ㅏ` → `달가` ✅ (ㄺ → ㄹ + ㄱ)
- `읽ㅏ` → `일가` ✅ (ㄺ → ㄹ + ㄱ)
- `밟ㅏ` → `발바` ✅ (ㄼ → ㄹ + ㅂ)
- `읊ㅏ` → `을파` ✅ (ㄿ → ㄹ + ㅍ)

## 🔧 Major Issues

### 3. Complex Medial Jamo Not Supported ✅ RESOLVED
**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** Closed  
**Description:** App can handle simple initial + medial combinations, but fails with complex medial vowels (diphthongs).

**Expected Behavior:**
- `ㅅㅗㅏ` should compose to `솨` (complex medial)
- Complex vowels like `ㅘ`, `ㅙ`, `ㅚ`, `ㅝ`, `ㅞ`, `ㅟ`, `ㅢ` should work

**Actual Behavior:**
- Complex medials are not properly composed
- Results in separate characters instead of single syllable
- May be treating complex vowels as separate inputs

**Technical Details:**
- Issue likely in `MEDIAL_VOWELS` Unicode mapping
- Complex vowels have different Unicode ranges
- May need special handling for diphthong composition

**Resolution:**
- ✅ Added `canFormComplexMedial()` function to check valid diphthong combinations
- ✅ Fixed Unicode character mismatch between Hangul Jamo and Compatibility Jamo
- ✅ Updated vowel processing logic to prioritize complex medial formation
- ✅ All modern Korean diphthongs now work correctly

**Test Cases:**
- `ㅅㅗㅏ` → `솨` ✅
- `ㄱㅗㅏ` → `과` ✅
- `ㅂㅜㅓ` → `붜` ✅
- `ㅎㅗㅏ` → `화` ✅

### 4. Complex Final Consonants Not Supported ✅ RESOLVED
**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** Closed  
**Description:** App cannot handle complex final consonants (consonant clusters at the end of syllables).

**Expected Behavior:**
- `ㄷㅏㄹㄱ` should compose to `닭` (complex final ㄺ)
- Complex finals like `ㄺ`, `ㄻ`, `ㄼ`, `ㄽ`, `ㄾ`, `ㄿ`, `ㅀ`, `ㅄ` should work
- All modern Korean complex finals should be supported

**Actual Behavior:**
- Complex finals are not properly composed
- Results in separate syllables instead of single syllable with complex final
- Final consonant becomes initial for next syllable

**Technical Details:**
- Issue in decomposition function producing wrong Unicode characters
- Unicode character mismatch between Hangul Jamo and Compatibility Jamo
- Missing complex final formation logic in processing pipeline

**Resolution:**
- ✅ Added `canFormComplexFinal()` function to check valid final combinations
- ✅ Fixed Unicode calculation in `decomposeHangulSyllable()` (0x11A7 + finalOffset)
- ✅ Updated processing logic to check for complex final formation before completing syllables
- ✅ All modern Korean complex finals now work correctly

**Test Cases:**
- `ㄷㅏㄹㄱ` → `닭` ✅
- `ㅅㅏㄹㅁ` → `삶` ✅
- `ㅂㅏㄹㅂ` → `밟` ✅
- `ㅇㅏㄴㅈ` → `앉` ✅

### 5. Variant Popup Positioning
**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** Open  
**Description:** Long-press variant popup has correct height relative to the pressed key, but is positioned too far to the right.

**Expected Behavior:**
- Popup should appear directly above the pressed key
- Centered horizontally over the key
- Close proximity for easy selection

**Actual Behavior:**
- Popup appears too far to the right of the key
- Horizontal positioning is incorrect
- Makes variant selection difficult

**Technical Details:**
- Issue in `showArchaicPopup` function in `KoreanKeyboard.tsx`
- `calculatedLeft` calculation is incorrect
- May be related to `popupWidth` calculation
- Affects all variant popups (consonants and vowels)

**Code Location:**
```typescript
// In KoreanKeyboard.tsx - showArchaicPopup function
const calculatedLeft = rect.left + (rect.width / 2) - (popupWidth / 2)
```

## 🏛️ Archaic Jamo Issues

### 6. Archaic Jamo Block Composition
**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** Open  
**Description:** Archaic jamo characters are incorrectly mapped and/or not mapped at all to compose syllabic blocks.

**Expected Behavior:**
- Archaic characters should compose into syllable blocks
- `ㅿㅏㄴ` should compose to `ᅀᅡᆫ`
- Historical Korean characters should work like modern ones

**Actual Behavior:**
- Archaic characters don't compose properly
- May result in Chinese characters or incorrect mappings
- Unicode composition fails for historical jamo

**Technical Details:**
- Issue in `ARCHAIC_INITIAL_CONSONANTS` mapping
- May be related to Unicode range validation in `composeSyllable`
- Range `0x1100-0x1116` may not include all archaic characters
- Need to investigate Microsoft Old Hangul IME approach

**Investigation Needed:**
- Research Microsoft Old Hangul IME implementation
- Check Unicode ranges for archaic characters
- Verify composition algorithm for historical jamo

## 🔍 Research & Investigation

### 7. Microsoft Old Hangul IME Analysis
**Priority:** Low  
**Status:** Research  
**Description:** Need to investigate how Microsoft Old Hangul IME handles archaic jamo composition.

**Research Goals:**
- Understand Microsoft's approach to archaic character composition
- Learn how they map jamo keys to compose blocks with archaic jamo
- Identify best practices for historical Korean character input

**Resources:**
- [Microsoft Old Hangul IME Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/globalization/input/korean-ime#using-the-microsoft-old-hangul-ime-for-historical-jamo)
- [Microsoft Globalization GitHub](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/globalization/blob/main/globalization/input/korean-ime.md)
- Unicode standards for Hangul Jamo
- Korean language computing standards

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Improved archaic character support
- Better Unicode mapping strategy
- Enhanced composition algorithm
