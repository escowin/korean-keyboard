# Korean Keyboard - Bugs & Issues Tracking

**Document Version:** 3.1  
**Last Updated:** October 2025  
**Status:** Typography Issues Resolved - Simplified Hangul Jamo Approach Complete

## 🚨 Critical Issues

### 1. Final Jamo Composition Failure ✅ RESOLVED
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Closed  
**Description:** Keyboard handles initial + medial correctly, but fails with initial + medial + final. The final consonant becomes the initial for the next syllable block.

**Expected Behavior:**
- `ㅅㅗㅎ` should compose to `솧` (one syllable block)
- Final consonant should complete the current syllable

**Actual Behavior:**
- `ㅅㅗㅎ` results in `솗ㅎ` or similar incorrect composition
- Final consonant `ㅎ` becomes initial for next block
- Syllable composition is broken for 3-character sequences

**Technical Details:**
- Issue in `processKoreanInput` function logic
- Problem likely in consonant handling when `currentSyllable.final` exists
- May be related to Unicode composition algorithm
- Affects all final consonants, not just specific ones

**Resolution:**
- ✅ Added `isComposedHangulSyllable()` and `decomposeHangulSyllable()` functions
- ✅ Fixed Unicode mapping between Jamo and Compatibility Jamo characters
- ✅ Created specific helper functions for each jamo type (initial, medial, final)
- ✅ Corrected final offset calculation to use 1-indexed values per Wikipedia standard
- ✅ All modern Korean syllables now compose correctly

**Test Cases:**
- `ㅅㅗㅎ` → `솧` ✅
- `ㄱㅏㄴ` → `간` ✅
- `ㅂㅏㅁ` → `밤` ✅
- `바ㅇ` → `방` ✅

---

### 2. Complex Final Consonant Decomposition ✅ RESOLVED
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Closed  
**Description:** When a syllable with a complex final consonant is followed by a vowel, the first component of the complex final is lost instead of being retained in the original syllable.

**Expected Behavior:**
- `앉ㅏ` should become `안자` (앉 → 안 + 자)
- First component of complex final should stay in original syllable
- Second component should become initial of next syllable

**Actual Behavior:**
- `앉ㅏ` resulted in `아자` (lost the `ㄴ` from `ㄵ`)
- Complex final was completely removed from original syllable
- Only second component was used for next syllable

**Technical Details:**
- Issue in `processKoreanInput` function when handling complex finals followed by vowels
- Missing logic to decompose complex finals into components
- No mapping between complex finals and their component parts

**Resolution:**
- ✅ Added `decomposeComplexFinal()` function to split complex finals into Hangul Jamo components
- ✅ Updated input processor to handle complex final decomposition with simplified approach:
  - Keep first component in original syllable (e.g., ㄵ → ㄴ stays in 안)
  - Use second component as initial for next syllable (e.g., ㄵ → ㅈ becomes initial)
- ✅ Fixed Unicode mapping to return Hangul Jamo values instead of Compatibility Jamo
- ✅ All complex final transitions now work correctly with unified Hangul Jamo processing

**Test Cases:**
- `앉ㅏ` → `안자` ✅
- `닭ㅏ` → `달가` ✅ (ㄺ → ㄹ + ㄱ)
- `읽ㅏ` → `일가` ✅ (ㄺ → ㄹ + ㄱ)
- `밟ㅏ` → `발바` ✅ (ㄼ → ㄹ + ㅂ)
- `읊ㅏ` → `을파` ✅ (ㄿ → ㄹ + ㅍ)

## 🔧 Major Issues

### 3. Complex Medial Jamo Not Supported ✅ RESOLVED
**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** Closed  
**Description:** App can handle simple initial + medial combinations, but fails with complex medial vowels (diphthongs).

**Expected Behavior:**
- `ㅅㅗㅏ` should compose to `솨` (complex medial)
- Complex vowels like `ㅘ`, `ㅙ`, `ㅚ`, `ㅝ`, `ㅞ`, `ㅟ`, `ㅢ` should work

**Actual Behavior:**
- Complex medials are not properly composed
- Results in separate characters instead of single syllable
- May be treating complex vowels as separate inputs

**Technical Details:**
- Issue likely in `MEDIAL_VOWELS` Unicode mapping
- Complex vowels have different Unicode ranges
- May need special handling for diphthong composition

**Resolution:**
- ✅ Added `canFormComplexMedial()` function to check valid diphthong combinations
- ✅ Fixed Unicode character mismatch by using Hangul Jamo values in complex medial mappings
- ✅ Updated vowel processing logic to prioritize complex medial formation
- ✅ All modern Korean diphthongs now work correctly with unified Hangul Jamo approach

**Test Cases:**
- `ㅅㅗㅏ` → `솨` ✅
- `ㄱㅗㅏ` → `과` ✅
- `ㅂㅜㅓ` → `붜` ✅
- `ㅎㅗㅏ` → `화` ✅

---

### 4. Complex Final Consonants Not Supported ✅ RESOLVED
**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** Closed  
**Description:** App cannot handle complex final consonants (consonant clusters at the end of syllables).

**Expected Behavior:**
- `ㄷㅏㄹㄱ` should compose to `닭` (complex final ㄺ)
- Complex finals like `ㄺ`, `ㄻ`, `ㄼ`, `ㄽ`, `ㄾ`, `ㄿ`, `ㅀ`, `ㅄ` should work
- All modern Korean complex finals should be supported

**Actual Behavior:**
- Complex finals are not properly composed
- Results in separate syllables instead of single syllable with complex final
- Final consonant becomes initial for next syllable

**Technical Details:**
- Issue in decomposition function producing wrong Unicode characters
- Unicode character mismatch between Hangul Jamo and Compatibility Jamo
- Missing complex final formation logic in processing pipeline

**Resolution:**
- ✅ Added `canFormComplexFinal()` function to check valid final combinations
- ✅ Simplified approach using Hangul Jamo concatenation instead of Unicode calculation
- ✅ Updated processing logic to check for complex final formation before completing syllables
- ✅ All modern Korean complex finals now work correctly with unified Hangul Jamo processing

**Test Cases:**
- `ㄷㅏㄹㄱ` → `닭` ✅
- `ㅅㅏㄹㅁ` → `삶` ✅
- `ㅂㅏㄹㅂ` → `밟` ✅
- `ㅇㅏㄴㅈ` → `앉` ✅

---

### 5. Variant Popup Positioning ✅ MOSTLY RESOLVED
**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** Compromise  
**Description:** Long-press variant popup positioning has been improved with a compromise solution.

**Expected Behavior:**
- Popup should appear directly above the pressed key
- Centered horizontally over the key
- Close proximity for easy selection

**Actual Behavior:**
- ✅ Popup appears at correct height above the pressed key
- ✅ Popup is centered horizontally on the keyboard (compromise solution)
- ✅ Pure React state management (no DOM manipulation)
- ✅ Reliable and consistent positioning

**Technical Details:**
- ✅ Simplified to pure React state management
- ✅ Uses `left: '50%'` and `transform: 'translateX(-50%)'` for centering
- ✅ Removed complex DOM manipulation and timing issues
- ✅ Popup appears consistently above keys with proper height

**Resolution:**
- ✅ Removed DOM manipulation approach (too complex)
- ✅ Implemented pure React state management
- ✅ Centered popup positioning (compromise - not key-specific but reliable)
- ✅ Popup now appears consistently and reliably

### 7. Archaic Initial + Medial + ㄹ Final Consonant Issue ✅ RESOLVED
**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** Closed  
**Description:** When using archaic initial and medial jamo with ㄹ as the final consonant, the ㄹ wasn't rendering correctly in its final position.

**Expected Behavior:**
- `△ㅗㄹ` should compose to `ᅀᅩᆯ` (archaic initial + medial + ㄹ final)
