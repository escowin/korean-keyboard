# Korean Keyboard - Bugs & Issues Tracking

**Document Version:** 3.0  
**Last Updated:** December 2024  
**Status:** Modern Korean Complete - All Core Features Working

## 🚨 Critical Issues

### 1. Final Jamo Composition Failure ✅ RESOLVED
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Closed  
**Description:** Keyboard handles initial + medial correctly, but fails with initial + medial + final. The final consonant becomes the initial for the next syllable block.

**Expected Behavior:**
- `ㅅㅗㅎ` should compose to `솧` (one syllable block)
- Final consonant should complete the current syllable

**Actual Behavior:**
- `ㅅㅗㅎ` results in `솗ㅎ` or similar incorrect composition
- Final consonant `ㅎ` becomes initial for next block
- Syllable composition is broken for 3-character sequences

**Technical Details:**
- Issue in `processKoreanInput` function logic
- Problem likely in consonant handling when `currentSyllable.final` exists
- May be related to Unicode composition algorithm
- Affects all final consonants, not just specific ones

**Resolution:**
- ✅ Added `isComposedHangulSyllable()` and `decomposeHangulSyllable()` functions
- ✅ Fixed Unicode mapping between Jamo and Compatibility Jamo characters
- ✅ Created specific helper functions for each jamo type (initial, medial, final)
- ✅ Corrected final offset calculation to use 1-indexed values per Wikipedia standard
- ✅ All modern Korean syllables now compose correctly

**Test Cases:**
- `ㅅㅗㅎ` → `솧` ✅
- `ㄱㅏㄴ` → `간` ✅
- `ㅂㅏㅁ` → `밤` ✅
- `바ㅇ` → `방` ✅

### 2. Complex Final Consonant Decomposition ✅ RESOLVED
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Closed  
**Description:** When a syllable with a complex final consonant is followed by a vowel, the first component of the complex final is lost instead of being retained in the original syllable.

**Expected Behavior:**
- `앉ㅏ` should become `안자` (앉 → 안 + 자)
- First component of complex final should stay in original syllable
- Second component should become initial of next syllable

**Actual Behavior:**
- `앉ㅏ` resulted in `아자` (lost the `ㄴ` from `ㄵ`)
- Complex final was completely removed from original syllable
- Only second component was used for next syllable

**Technical Details:**
- Issue in `processKoreanInput` function when handling complex finals followed by vowels
- Missing logic to decompose complex finals into components
- No mapping between complex finals and their component parts

**Resolution:**
- ✅ Added `COMPLEX_FINAL_TO_COMPONENTS` mapping for all modern complex finals
- ✅ Created `decomposeComplexFinal()` function to split complex finals
- ✅ Updated input processor to handle complex final decomposition:
  - Keep first component in original syllable (e.g., ㄵ → ㄴ stays in 안)
  - Use second component as initial for next syllable (e.g., ㄵ → ㅈ becomes initial)
- ✅ All complex final transitions now work correctly

**Test Cases:**
- `앉ㅏ` → `안자` ✅
- `닭ㅏ` → `달가` ✅ (ㄺ → ㄹ + ㄱ)
- `읽ㅏ` → `일가` ✅ (ㄺ → ㄹ + ㄱ)
- `밟ㅏ` → `발바` ✅ (ㄼ → ㄹ + ㅂ)
- `읊ㅏ` → `을파` ✅ (ㄿ → ㄹ + ㅍ)

## 🔧 Major Issues

### 3. Complex Medial Jamo Not Supported ✅ RESOLVED
**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** Closed  
**Description:** App can handle simple initial + medial combinations, but fails with complex medial vowels (diphthongs).

**Expected Behavior:**
- `ㅅㅗㅏ` should compose to `솨` (complex medial)
- Complex vowels like `ㅘ`, `ㅙ`, `ㅚ`, `ㅝ`, `ㅞ`, `ㅟ`, `ㅢ` should work

**Actual Behavior:**
- Complex medials are not properly composed
- Results in separate characters instead of single syllable
- May be treating complex vowels as separate inputs

**Technical Details:**
- Issue likely in `MEDIAL_VOWELS` Unicode mapping
- Complex vowels have different Unicode ranges
- May need special handling for diphthong composition

**Resolution:**
- ✅ Added `canFormComplexMedial()` function to check valid diphthong combinations
- ✅ Fixed Unicode character mismatch between Hangul Jamo and Compatibility Jamo
- ✅ Updated vowel processing logic to prioritize complex medial formation
- ✅ All modern Korean diphthongs now work correctly

**Test Cases:**
- `ㅅㅗㅏ` → `솨` ✅
- `ㄱㅗㅏ` → `과` ✅
- `ㅂㅜㅓ` → `붜` ✅
- `ㅎㅗㅏ` → `화` ✅

### 4. Complex Final Consonants Not Supported ✅ RESOLVED
**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** Closed  
**Description:** App cannot handle complex final consonants (consonant clusters at the end of syllables).

**Expected Behavior:**
- `ㄷㅏㄹㄱ` should compose to `닭` (complex final ㄺ)
- Complex finals like `ㄺ`, `ㄻ`, `ㄼ`, `ㄽ`, `ㄾ`, `ㄿ`, `ㅀ`, `ㅄ` should work
- All modern Korean complex finals should be supported

**Actual Behavior:**
- Complex finals are not properly composed
- Results in separate syllables instead of single syllable with complex final
- Final consonant becomes initial for next syllable

**Technical Details:**
- Issue in decomposition function producing wrong Unicode characters
- Unicode character mismatch between Hangul Jamo and Compatibility Jamo
- Missing complex final formation logic in processing pipeline

**Resolution:**
- ✅ Added `canFormComplexFinal()` function to check valid final combinations
- ✅ Fixed Unicode calculation in `decomposeHangulSyllable()` (0x11A7 + finalOffset)
- ✅ Updated processing logic to check for complex final formation before completing syllables
- ✅ All modern Korean complex finals now work correctly

**Test Cases:**
- `ㄷㅏㄹㄱ` → `닭` ✅
- `ㅅㅏㄹㅁ` → `삶` ✅
- `ㅂㅏㄹㅂ` → `밟` ✅
- `ㅇㅏㄴㅈ` → `앉` ✅

### 5. Variant Popup Positioning
**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** Open  
**Description:** Long-press variant popup has correct height relative to the pressed key, but is positioned too far to the right.

**Expected Behavior:**
- Popup should appear directly above the pressed key
- Centered horizontally over the key
- Close proximity for easy selection

**Actual Behavior:**
- Popup appears too far to the right of the key
- Horizontal positioning is incorrect
- Makes variant selection difficult

**Technical Details:**
- Issue in `showArchaicPopup` function in `KoreanKeyboard.tsx`
- `calculatedLeft` calculation is incorrect
- May be related to `popupWidth` calculation
- Affects all variant popups (consonants and vowels)

**Code Location:**
```typescript
// In KoreanKeyboard.tsx - showArchaicPopup function
const calculatedLeft = rect.left + (rect.width / 2) - (popupWidth / 2)
```

## 🏛️ Archaic Jamo Issues

### 6. Archaic Jamo Block Composition ✅ MOSTLY RESOLVED
**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** In Progress  
**Description:** Archaic jamo characters are now mostly working with corrected Unicode mappings.

**Expected Behavior:**
- Archaic characters should compose into syllable blocks
- `△ㅏㄴ` should compose to `ᅀᅡᆫ` (combined block)
- Historical Korean characters should work like modern ones

**Actual Behavior:**
- ✅ Most archaic initial consonants now work correctly
- ✅ Unicode mappings corrected for proper Hangul Jamo conversion
- ⚠️ Some medial vowel mappings still need fixing
- ⚠️ Archaic vowels need integration into keyboard layout

**Technical Details:**
- ✅ Fixed Unicode conversion mappings in `COMPATIBILITY_TO_HANGUL_JAMO`
- ✅ Updated detection logic to cover all archaic jamo ranges
- ✅ React state management working for archaic jamo rendering
- ⚠️ Some medial vowel Unicode values need correction
- ⚠️ Archaic vowels (ㆍ, ᆢ) need keyboard layout integration

**Resolution Progress:**
- ✅ Added comprehensive archaic initial consonant mappings
- ✅ Fixed Unicode ranges for archaic jamo detection
- ✅ Implemented React state management for archaic jamo
- ✅ Most archaic jamo now render as combined blocks
- ⚠️ Remaining: Fix medial mappings and integrate archaic vowels

**Test Cases:**
- `△ㅏㄴ` → `ᅀᅡᆫ` ✅ (working)
- `ㆆㅏㄴ` → `ᅙᅡᆫ` ✅ (working)
- `ㆍㅏㄴ` → `ᆞᅡᆫ` ⚠️ (medial mapping needs fix)
- `ㅸㅏㄴ` → `ᄫᅡᆫ` ✅ (working)
